# 🔧 Fix: Stuck on "Authorized" Window

## Quick Solution

The "Authorized" window is just a confirmation. The connection is likely already complete!

### Step 1: Close the "Authorized" Window
- **Close the window/tab** that says "Authorized"
- You can safely close it - the authorization is already done

### Step 2: Refresh Netlify Page
1. Go back to the Netlify tab/window
2. **Refresh the page** (Press `F5` or `Cmd+R` / `Ctrl+R`)
3. Or navigate to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/lucky-pika-f00e5b/link

### Step 3: Select Your Repository
After refreshing, you should see:
- A list of your GitHub repositories
- Look for **`mtalhas808-crypto/Repo`**
- Click on it to select
- Click **"Save"** or **"Connect"**

## Alternative: Direct Link Method

If the above doesn't work, try this:

1. **Close the "Authorized" window**
2. Go directly to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/lucky-pika-f00e5b/link
3. You should now see the repository selection page
4. Select `mtalhas808-crypto/Repo`
5. Continue with the setup

## If Still Stuck

If you still don't see the repository selection:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/lucky-pika-f00e5b/configuration/deploys
2. Click **"Link repository"** again
3. Click **"GitHub"** - it should now skip authorization (already done)
4. Select your repository

## Why This Happens

The "Authorized" window is just a confirmation message. Sometimes it doesn't automatically close, but the authorization is already complete. Just close it manually and continue!

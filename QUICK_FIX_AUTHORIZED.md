# ⚡ Quick Fix: Stuck on "Authorized" Window

## ✅ Simple Solution (Do This Now)

**The "Authorized" window is just a confirmation - you can safely close it!**

### Steps:

1. **Close the "Authorized" window/tab** - Just close it, don't wait for it
2. **Go to this URL**: https://app.netlify.com/projects/lucky-pika-f00e5b/link
3. **Click "GitHub"** again (authorization is already done, so it will skip to repository selection)
4. **Select your repository**: `mtalhas808-crypto/Repo`
5. **Click "Save"** or **"Connect"**

---

## Why This Works

The "Authorized" message means GitHub has already approved Netlify. The window sometimes doesn't close automatically, but the authorization is complete. Just close it manually and continue!

## If You Still See "Link repository"

If after closing the window and refreshing you still see "Link repository":

1. Click **"Link repository"**
2. Click **"GitHub"** 
3. Since authorization is done, it should immediately show your repositories
4. Select `mtalhas808-crypto/Repo`
5. Continue

---

## After Repository Selection

Once you select the repository, Netlify will:
- ✅ Connect to your GitHub repo
- ✅ Set up automatic deployments
- ✅ Deploy your site automatically

**Then future deployments are FREE with just `git push`!**
